# Utilizing machine learning to predict the flight price from JFK(NY) to PVG(SHA) on Thanksgiving.

In the United States, the machine learning has been widely used in variety of systems. Some companies have analytics software based on the certain statistical model in machine learning to automatically identify patterns from the consumers and inventories, and predict the price for the different consumers. When you want to book flights and hotels on the Orbitz or Expedia, the displayed price should be an individual list. According to the consumers purchased histories, the productsâ€™ preferences, the product return proportion, consumer credit reports, and something closely related to the pricing prediction, it is a possibility to carry out the individual customized service. For this accurate prediction of costumer behaviors, there is another attempt to figure out how to predict the price for helping make the purchase decision. In this project, we are going to utilize machine learning to predict the flight price from JFK(NY) to PVG(SHA)on Thanksgiving.
